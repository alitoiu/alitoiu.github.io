<div class="section">
<p>
I was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest" target="_blank">Bucharest</a>, grew up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto" target="_blank">Toronto</a>, and reside in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut" target="_blank">New Haven</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I spend a lot of my free time working on <a href="/personal_projects">personal projects</a>, and learning new skills. To unwind, I read, play sports, and enjoy stand-up comedy.

## Athletics
<div class="section">

<p>
I used to play soccer and tennis competitively, winning a number of national championships at the high school level. I also rowed crew, competitively. 
</p>

<p>
These days, I play soccer for cardiovascular fitness and I strength train with the goal of matching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mlkVwZVPN8" target="_blank">Rich Froning's 1020 lb clean, overhead squat, and bench press total.</a>
</p>

</div>

## Books
<div class="section">
<p>I enjoy biography, non-fiction, history, business, science fiction, and psychology.</p>

<p>
Reading a book allows you to spend 3 to 30 hours with a historical world expert that is laying out for you his or her life's work in a distilled fashion. For the past couple of years, I have read a different book every week.<a href="{{site.goodreads_url}}" target="_blank"> These are the books that I have found to be particularly enriching.</a> </p>

## Pictures

When I am in a beautiful place, or am with beautiful people, I enjoy dabbling in photography. <a href="https://plus.google.com/114623329975040741113/photos" target="_blank">Here are some of the pictures I have taken.</a>

## Friends

I love my friends. Here are some of the things that they are working on:

* <a href="http://volley.works/" target="_blank">Queries where the answer is a person</a>
* <a href="http://www.jamcam.co/" target="_blank">Capture and share life's musical moments in short, looping videos</a>
* <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/" target="_blank">Improving the food consumption ecosystem</a>
