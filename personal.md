<div class="section">
<p>
I was born in Bucharest, grew up in Toronto, and reside in New Haven. 
</p>
<p>
I spend a lot of my free time working on <a href="/personal_projects">personal projects</a>, and learning new skills. To unwind, I read, play sports, and enjoy stand-up comedy. 
</p>

## Athletics
<div class="section">

<p>
I used to play soccer and tennis competitively, winning a number of national championships at the high school level. I also rowed crew, competitively. 
</p>

<p>
These days, I play soccer, play tennis, and <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/alitoiu" target="_blank">cycle</a> to stay fit. I strength train with the goal of matching <a href="http://youtu.be/0mlkVwZVPN8?t=4m43s" target="_blank">Rich Froning's 1020 lb clean, overhead squat, and bench press total.</a>
</p>

## Books
<div class="section">
<p>I enjoy biography, non-fiction, history, business, science fiction, and psychology.</p>

<p>
Reading a book allows you to spend 3 to 30 hours with a historical world expert that is laying out for you his or her life's work in a distilled fashion. For the past couple of years, I have read a different book every week. <a href="{{site.goodreads_url}}" target="_blank">These are the books that I have found to be particularly enriching.</a> </p>

## Pictures

When I am in a beautiful place, or am with beautiful people, I enjoy dabbling in photography. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/alitoiu/" target="_blank">Here are some of the pictures I have taken.</a>

## Friends

I love my friends. Here are some of the things that they are working on:

* <a href="http://volley.works/" target="_blank">Queries where the answer is a person</a>
* <a href="http://www.jamcam.co/" target="_blank">Capture and share life's musical moments in short, looping videos</a>
* <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/" target="_blank">Improving the food consumption ecosystem</a>
