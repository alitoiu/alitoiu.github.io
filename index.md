I'm a third year Computer Science PhD candidate working with 
[Brian Scassellati](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/) in the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/). I am interested in socially assistive robotics, artificial intelligence, intelligent tutoring systems, and machine learning. 

My long-term objective is to build companions that learn your habits and skills, and give you effective, personalized advice to improve at your goals. My current research focuses on using robots to coach physical skills such as teaching a child how to shoot a basketball.

In 2012, I co-founded [Atlus Inc.](/projects/2012-Atlus.html), which was acquired by [Purple Forge Corp](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/purple-forge-corp) in 2013.

For my <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4354160/alitoiu/Curriculum_Vitae/cv.pdf" target="_blank">entrepreneurial and academic accomplishments</a>, I have been named one of [The Next 36](http://www.thenext36.ca/) entrepreneurial leaders of Canada, and awarded an [NSERC PGS](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/bellandpostgrad-belletsuperieures_eng.asp), and two [NSERC USRA](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp) national scholarships. I received my Bachelors in Applied Science in Computer Engineering at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/).
