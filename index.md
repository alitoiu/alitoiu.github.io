I am a third year Computer Science PhD candidate working with 
[Brian Scassellati](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/) in the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/). I am interested in socially assistive robotics, artificial intelligence, intelligent tutoring systems, and machine learning. 

My long-term objective is to build companions that learn your habits and skills, and give you effective, personalized advice to help you accomplish your goals. To that end, my current research focuses on using robots to coach physical skills such as shooting a basketball.

In 2012, I co-founded [Atlus Inc.](/projects/2012-Atlus.html), which was acquired by [Purple Forge Corp](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/purple-forge-corp) in 2013.

For my <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4354160/alitoiu/Curriculum_Vitae/cv.pdf" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4354160/alitoiu/Curriculum_Vitae/cv.pdf'); return false;">entrepreneurial and academic accomplishments</a>, I have been named one of [The Next 36](http://www.thenext36.ca/) entrepreneurial leaders of Canada, awarded an [NSERC PGS](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/bellandpostgrad-belletsuperieures_eng.asp) national scholarship, and two [NSERC USRA](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp) national awards. I received my Bachelors in Applied Science in Computer Engineering at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/).
