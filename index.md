I am a software engineer currently spending my time writing a book about my experiences with burnout and recovery. I am interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and intelligent tutoring systems.

Prior to that, I worked at [Facebook](http://facebook.com) using machine learning to keep users safe from fraudulent and offensive content. 

Before joining Facebook, I received my Master of Science in Computer Science with 
[Brian Scassellati](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/) in the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/). There, I designed companions that learn your habits and skills to give you [effective, personalized advice to help you accomplish your goals.](/publications)

In 2012, I co-founded [Atlus Inc.](/projects/2012-Atlus.html), which was acquired by [Purple Forge Corp](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/purple-forge-corp) in 2013.

For my <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4354160/alitoiu/Curriculum_Vitae/cv.pdf" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4354160/alitoiu/Curriculum_Vitae/cv.pdf'); return false;">entrepreneurial and academic accomplishments</a>, I have been named one of [The Next 36](http://www.thenext36.ca/) entrepreneurial leaders of Canada, awarded an [NSERC PGS](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/bellandpostgrad-belletsuperieures_eng.asp) national scholarship, and two [NSERC USRA](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp) national awards. I received my Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/).
